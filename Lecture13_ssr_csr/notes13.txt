SSR VS CSR ->

RENDERING :

CSR->  { client side rendering }
send req to backend for data,
manipulate data (Dom || React) to show UI,
backend and frontend are both different.

SSR-> { server side rendering }
browser send req to get the HTML file,
manipulation is done on backend,
backend serves the UI.


AXIOS -> send api req , frontend se backend ko req send krna h to axios use hota h like fetch but improved , provides easy syntax for fetch
