alag stack me run hote h (web api ) and result is thrown in main stack.

NODE JS EVENT CYCLE ->
1. req is send from postman or from frontend(client)
2. res is send in respect to every req (one res for one req)(no res is also valid)
3. event queue principle -> FIFO is followed 
4. event loop 
5. workers are the threads that perform tasks and functions requested by api req 

non blocking honi chiye requests 
callback functions sare async hone chaiye 

1. event queue checking for requests 
2. categorising req into blocking and non blocking 
3. if non blocking then only check thread for avalability
